# Gimp Palette Sorter
Script(s) for sort by color GIMP's palettes.
I'm using this project to learn GIT / GitHub.

Update: This doesn't works as espected.
When I put the genereted palette in GIMP, 
it just sorts again by how it was originally :(

BTW I think parsing functions works well... I'm not very sure
and, at this time, I have no energy and moral to check it so...
Cya.
